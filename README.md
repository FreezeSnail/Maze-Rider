# Maze-Rider
Maze crawler where you hunt for parts of a unicycle.

This is a simple maze wandering game where you seek the 5 pieces of a unicycle.  It's relatively simple as I ran short on time for some things I wanted( pause screen displaying what pieces you've found etc.)  But the core mechanics I wanted are present.  

The important info:

    Character: C
    
    //Move between floor tiles
    Upstairs: U
    Downstairs: D
    
    //move through in one direction tiles
    Left Gate: <
    Right Gate: >
    Upwards Gate: ^
    Downwards Gate: v

    //part tiles
    Parts:
    Seat: ~
    Stem: l
    Crank: z
    wheel: o
    Pedals: =








To Do:
---------
* add inbetween screen for stages.
* add saving level.
* add level select screen.
* implement art.
* make pause screen not horrible.
* add tutorial page.
* write tutorial to add levels(ez pz);
* better document code
* add levels with gate tiles



Maybes:

* add a background music theme.
* write a cheeseball story page


Done:
--------
