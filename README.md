# Maze-Rider
Maze crawler where you hunt for parts of a unicycle.

This is a simple maze wandering game where you seek the 5 pieces of a unicycle.  It's relatively simple as I ran short on time for some things I wanted( pause screen displaying what pieces you've found etc.)  But the core mechanics I wanted are present.  

The important info:

    Character: C
    
    Move between floor tiles:
    -------------------------
    Upstairs: U
    Downstairs: D
    
    Move through in one direction tiles:
    ------------------------------------
    Left Gate: <
    Right Gate: >
    Upwards Gate: ^
    Downwards Gate: v

    Part tiles:
    -----------
    Parts:
    Seat: ~
    Stem: l
    Crank: z
    wheel: o
    Pedals: =

---------
* add inbetween screen for stages.
* add saving level.
